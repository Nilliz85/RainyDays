# RainyDays

school project.

this is a website for a company caller RAINYDAYS. the company sells jackets made of recycled materials and hav a jacket for every adventure... they also play instagram hard. i set up an instagram account for the company and posted some pictures and then build an instagram feed on the website, all the pictures (not hero images) are links that will take you to the same picture on instagram.

the social media links in the footer takes you to the appropriate social media platform,
where you will land on the search page, showing the result for #RAINYDAYS search.

except for instagram which ofc leads you to the instagram account i created.

all the pictures are hashtagged with the photographers name
